ChatBotBDD is an extremely basic interactive command-line
application in Ruby, developed using behavior-driven
principles with Cucumber and Aruba. The goal is to showcase
the process of using BDD with simple Ruby command-line
applications.

The application should have no requirements outside Ruby
itself; running the tests will require Ruby Gems, Cucumber,
and Aruba. Everything was written and tested with Ruby 1.8.7.
